            Founded in 2010 by a group of literature lovers, Layla's Book Store began as a small independent bookstore in a quaint neighborhood. Our mission was simple: to create a haven for book lovers where they could find their next great read, connect with other book enthusiasts, and foster a love for reading. Over the years, our love for books and commitment to our customers allowed us to grow, and we transitioned into the online world to reach readers everywhere.
